Typography

Font family: Inter

Use a clear hierarchy:

H1: large, bold (hero name)

H2: section titles (“Proof of Work”, “About”, etc.)

Body: relaxed line-height, readable

Text color: near-black for headings, muted gray for body copy

Colors

Background: off-white / very light neutral

Primary text: near-black

Accent color: soft blue (used for:

links

featured badges

highlighted metrics

subtle borders on featured cards)

Borders: very light gray

Shadows: minimal and soft (barely noticeable)

Spacing & Layout

Generous whitespace throughout

Do not compress vertical spacing

Text blocks have a comfortable max width (not full screen)

Section spacing is consistent from top to bottom

Buttons

Primary button: dark background, white text

Secondary button: light background with dark border

Rounded corners, not pill-shaped

No aggressive hover animations (simple color/border change only)

Project Cards

Featured project:

Subtle accent border

“Featured” badge

Slightly larger container

Secondary projects:

Neutral borders

Same rounded corner radius

Project images:

Exactly one per project

Rounded corners

Light border

No mockups, no stock imagery

Images support understanding, not decoration

Tags / Badges

Used for tech stack and “Applied to …”

Small, rounded, neutral background

Text-first, low visual weight

Tone & Intent

Calm, thoughtful, builder-focused

No marketing language

No buzzwords

Feels like a real person who ships and reflects

Things to Avoid

No flashy animations

No gradients

No background patterns

No icon overuse

No design “enhancements” beyond screenshots

Screenshots are the primary source of truth. These notes only clarify intent where visuals may be ambiguous.
